# Statistical rethinking

This repo contains code and comments related to the book [statistical rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)

PR are welcomed. Questions and comments are appreciated. In addition to freshing up on my statistical modeling one additional goal is to improve my understanding of collaboration using git. All contributions bring me closer to that goal.

I have not taken the time to make the layout in chapter 2 and 3 consistent. I'm considering refactoring questions to problems. Also, I'm considering changing the font size and the heading size.
